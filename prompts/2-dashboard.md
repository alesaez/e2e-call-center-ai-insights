Create a Dashboard component in a React web application that displays key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for a call center VP.
Requirements:

- KPIs include: total call volume, average handling time, customer satisfaction score, agent availability, and escalation rate.
- Use responsive design with Material UI or TailwindCSS.
- Include charts and graphs (e.g., using Chart.js or Recharts).
- Place the dashboard as the first item in a collapsible left-side navigation menu with a placeholder for the customer logo at the top left.
- Backend should provide mock API endpoints in Python (FastAPI or Flask) to serve KPI data.
Ensure the layout is fully responsive and supports white labeling (dynamic branding, logo, and theme per tenant).
